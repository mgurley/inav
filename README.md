# The Inflection Navigator

A patient receives a serious diagnosis from his or her physician. The physician instructs the patient to setup 3 tests, see 2 specialists and read material on the condition -- all within 2 weeks.

- This 'Inflection Point' in the patient's health requires a lot of effort and coordination.  But, what if the patient's clinic designated a "Navigator" to guide the patient through these activities.
- The Navigator follows a protocol tailored to the patient's diagnosis and ensures the protocol is completed in a timely and efficient manner.
- Each patient diagnosis requires the Navigator to manage a distinct set of activities within a scheduled time frame.

Ideally, the navigator would have a web-based tool that assists them in:

- Applying a consistent protocol of activities to each patient based on their diagnosis.
- Managing each patient's progress in completing the protocol.
- Tracking and detailing the outcome of each patient.

The Inflection Navigator is that tool.
