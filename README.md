# Inflection Navigator

A patient receives a serious diagnosis from his or her
physician. The physician instructs the patient to setup 3
tests, see 2 specialists and read material on the
condition -- all within 2 weeks.
- This 'Inflection Point' in the patient's health requires a lot
of effort and coordination.
- The Northwestern Memorial Physicians Group designates
a "Navigator" to guide the patient through these
activities.
- The Navigator follows a protocol tailored to the patient's
diagnosis and ensures the protocol is completed in a
timely and efficient manner.
- Each patient diagnosis requires the Navigator to manage
a distinct set of activities within a scheduled time frame.
