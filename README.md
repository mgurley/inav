# The Inflection Navigator

A patient receives a serious diagnosis from his or her physician. The physician instructs the patient to setup 3 tests, see 2 specialists and read material on the condition -- all within 2 weeks.

- This 'Inflection Point' in the patient's health requires a lot of effort and coordination.  But, what if the patient's clinic designated a "Navigator" to guide the patient through these activities.
- The Navigator follows a protocol tailored to the patient's diagnosis and ensures the protocol is completed in a timely and efficient manner.
- Each patient diagnosis requires the Navigator to manage a distinct set of activities within a scheduled time frame.

Ideally, the Navigator would have a web-based tool that assists them in:

- Applying a consistent protocol of activities to each patient based on their diagnosis.
- Managing each patient's progress in completing the protocol.
- Tracking and detailing the outcome of each patient.

We have built such a tool -- the Inflection Navigator.

# Technical Architecture

The Inflection Navigator is hybrid of two applications:

1. A light-weight patient and provider registry written in Ruby on Rails.
1. A protocol and patient-calendar management java web application utilizing the Patient Study Calendar -- a National Cancer Institute caBIGÂ® open source software application.

Despite this hybrid architecture, a shared look and feel, inter-application communication via RESTful API calls and the implementation of the single sign on Central Authentication Service protocol make the application feel like a unified application.

In addition to the two core applications, the installation download folder contains two additional applications:

1.  A copy of the ESUP CAS Server configured to authenticate against a non-encrypted, file-based store of users.  This configuration should only be used for demonstration purposes.  For a production deployment, it should be replaced by an existing  CAS sever or be reconfigured to authenticated against a a secure store of users.  See [http://esup-casgeneric.sourceforge.net/install.html ](http://esup-casgeneric.sourceforge.net/install.html) for further details.
1.  A proxy call back application to enable the patient/provider Ruby on Rails application to make CAS proxy calls to the Patient Study Calendar.  See the documentation for the RubyCAS-Client for further an explanation of the necessity of running a separate Rails application to enable a Rails application to act as a CAS proxy: [http://rubycas-client.rubyforge.org/](http://rubycas-client.rubyforge.org/)
